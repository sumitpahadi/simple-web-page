                <p class="text-small">
                    Coding is the process of transforming ideas, solutions, and instructions into the language that the
                    computer can understand – that is, binary-machine code.
                    Coding is how humans are able to talk with computers.
                    Coding involves communicating and giving instructions for different actions we want our computers to
                    perform using a computer programming language.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
                language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing
                and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a
                scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn
                syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports
                modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the
                extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major
                platforms, and can be freely distributed

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Information about java</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year
                1995, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing,
                compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java
                is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation
                dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run
                anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are
                compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

                History: Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James
                Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated
                the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java
                1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by
                Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had
                multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.

                In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon
                withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without
                charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling
                of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

                On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On
                May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under open-source
                distribution terms .</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
                which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged
                programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It
                was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
                Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build
                modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional
                website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
                Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and
                provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers,
                databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language. .</p>
